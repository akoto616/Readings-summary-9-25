Response to Slate, FiveThirtyEight, Homicide Watch and Fatal Encounters
The revelation that there exists no national database for the number of gun-related homicides or police-related shootings and deaths, most notably after the Sandy Hook shootings and after the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, caused slight outrage and disbelief among reporters and news consumers. 

One reason why no database exists, at least in the case of gun-related deaths in general, is that it is a huge, enormous task. To do this in real-time, a government agency or office would need to dedicate all of its manpower to recording gun shootings that result in death in all of its iterations, and as Dan Kois of Slate points out, that work is not for the weary. The CDC compiled data for 2011 by looking at all death certificates generated nationwide. It was cumbersome, as coroner’s don’t always list deaths that are in fact gun related -- like suicides -- as gun related, and the CDC was unable to do this in real time. To accomplish this in an up-to-the-minute fashion, local, state and national bodies would have to standardize some system that wouldn’t be malleable to shallow definitions of “gun-related death.” This suggests that in order to do this effectively and consistently, collecting this information would have to be the sole province of one office/task force. 

In regard to murder at the hands of the police, one official record that exists is the FBI’s annual Supplementary Homicide Report, which counted 400 “justifiable murders.” But what about the unjustifiable homicides? There is no public record of those cases. (Side note: Would asking how many unarmed civilians have been shot and killed by police be a better question?)

(The conspiracy theorist/journalist in me is more inclined to buy this another secondary explanation: that there is no national database that regularly collects this information is intentional. Rather, there is no reliable source for this data because the people/agencies who should be charged with creating it don’t want it to exist, or that creating this list isn’t a priority for any number of reasons.)

Independent researchers -- reporters at Slate, the person(s) who manage @gundeaths and the creator of Fatal Encounters -- have primarily turned to crowdsourcing to collect the missing data. D. Brian Burghart from Fatal Encounters put out another formal call for help here at Gawker, shortly after the publication attempted to start their own crowdsourced database. Independent researchers might be crippled by some of  the same limitations that keep government agencies from collecting this data (even though they have more resources to beat those limitations), chief among them is the lack of consistency or agreement on what qualifies as a gun death. Slate’s obvious limitation is that they identified gun deaths only from news reports. What about gun deaths that don’t receive news coverage?

Once more, relying on crowdsourcing means trusting lots of people who care deeply about a subject, but might not be trained in how to deal with data.
